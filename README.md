# Models and Algorithms project
The repository contains the final project carried out for the course of Models and Algorithms at Collegio Carlo Alberto. <br>
The goal was to analyze a contact network of Potts variables through Bayesian inference. In order to accomplish the various tasks, we designed a Boltzmann Machine Learning scheme after performing a Maximum a Posteriori estimation.
